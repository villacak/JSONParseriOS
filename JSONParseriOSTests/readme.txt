JSONParser

SWIFT v.: 3.0
XCode v.: 8.1

Created by Klaus Villaca on 12/01/16.

The main reason I have created it was due the need to keep writting boiler plate code for work with JSON
across my projects.
I have saw a several JSON libs and project in GitHub, all of them were quite good, with
a few having better performance than others.
However as for my own learning I did build this small project that I don't know yet if it will perform well,
average or poor. I could notice that SWIFT is good to work with Generics though still has room for improvment
like Generics for Java or other languages, that would simplify even more the code.
I make and run some more tests to later add those test to the repository.
This project enables you to parse JSON from/to using structs, NSObject classes and pure SWIFT classes.

I also have 'gave' some naming for those groups, something that would be similar with what Java has
(sorry though I am a Java developer for a long time and it make inevitable to don't draw comparations).
If SWIFT has already name for those simple classes/structs please feel free to update it.

Groups name:
PSO - Plain Swift Objects, class based;
PSS - Plain Swift Struct, struct based.

I have included just those success tests.
I also think that I have covered the most used var types and uses to work with JSON.
Please feel free to fork the project and improve it, as it's my first lib project, I know that I need to make
it as a framework, though like I said earlier, I am still learning.
